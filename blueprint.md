# Lotto Number Recommendation Site

## Overview

A simple, visually appealing single-page application that generates and displays random lotto number recommendations. The application will have a clean, modern, and engaging user interface.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Theme:** Modern, clean, and fun, with a slightly retro feel.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant color palette will be used for the lotto balls, with a contrasting background.
    *   Background: A dark, slightly textured background (`#2c3e50`).
    *   Lotto Balls: A set of bright, distinct colors (e.g., `#e74c3c`, `#3498db`, `#2ecc71`, `#f1c40f`, `#9b59b6`, `#e67e22`).
    *   Text & Buttons: White text (`#ecf0f1`) for readability and a prominent color for the call-to-action button.
*   **Typography:** A clean, sans-serif font like 'Montserrat' from Google Fonts.
*   **Layout:** A centered layout with the title, lotto number display, and the "Generate" button stacked vertically. The layout will be responsive and work well on mobile devices.
*   **Visual Effects:**
    *   **Noise Texture:** A subtle noise texture on the background for a premium feel.
    *   **Shadows:** Soft drop shadows on the lotto balls and the button to create a sense of depth.
    *   **Animation:** A simple, satisfying animation when the numbers are generated.

### Features

*   **Number Generation:**
    *   Generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
    *   The generation is triggered by a user clicking a "Generate Numbers" button.
*   **Display:**
    *   The 6 generated numbers are displayed as colored "lotto balls."
    *   Each ball will clearly show its number.
*   **Interactivity:**
    *   A prominent "Generate Numbers" button initiates the number generation.
    *   The button will have a clear hover and active state.

## Current Plan

*   **HTML (`index.html`):** Set up the basic structure of the page, including a title, a container for the lotto balls, and a button.
*   **CSS (`style.css`):** Implement the visual design, including the color scheme, layout, typography, and effects.
*   **JavaScript (`main.js`):** Implement the logic for generating unique random numbers and updating the display.
